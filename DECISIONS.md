# DECISIONS.md — rapidkoi

Tracks architectural and design questions that are open, deferred, or resolved.

Rules:
- Every open decision blocks implementation of the code it affects.
- The AI must not implement anything that depends on an open decision.
- When a decision is resolved, move it to the RESOLVED section and record the outcome.
- Once resolved, copy the outcome to MEMORY.md as an architectural decision.

## OPEN — Requires human input before implementation

(none)

---

## DEFERRED — Acknowledged, not yet needed

### DECISION-002 — Publishing

**Status:** deferred
**Raised:** 2026-10-17 — Session 1
**Revisit when:** The user wants a remote, or a first release.

**Question:** Where is the repository hosted (e.g. `kithinjibrian/rapidkoi` on GitHub), public or private, and under what license?

**Notes:** Safe to defer: work is local-only until then, and no push happens without asking.

---

### DECISION-007 — Platforms beyond GTK desktop

**Status:** deferred
**Raised:** 2026-10-17 — Session 2
**Revisit when:** Work on Android, macOS or Windows starts.

**Question:** kivuli renders to GTK 4 only. How do Android (and native macOS/Windows) get a renderer?

**Notes:** Safe to defer: the vision's build path is desktop first, and Linux is the development machine. Keeping the guest contract (DECISION-005) independent of GTK keeps this open.

---

### DECISION-008 — Process isolation for apps

**Status:** deferred
**Raised:** 2026-10-17 — Session 2
**Revisit when:** Before the shell runs any bundle it didn't load from a local file the user chose (build path step 2).

**Question:** The vision says each app runs separately from Rapidkoi itself. In-process sandbox only, or a separate process per app?

**Notes:** In step 1 the person only opens local bundles they picked, and the runtime's sandbox plus fuel and memory limits contain a faulty one.

---

### DECISION-009 — Manifest, bundle format and signing

**Status:** deferred
**Raised:** 2026-10-17 — Session 2
**Revisit when:** Build path step 2 (links and addresses).

**Question:** The manifest's format and location at a domain, the bundle's container format, content addressing, and how domain-tied keys are verified.

**Notes:** Signing is cryptography: human review is required (SECURITY RULE). Step 1 loads a bare `.wasm` file.

---

### DECISION-011 — How synced app data resolves conflicts

**Status:** deferred
**Raised:** 2026-10-17 — Session 3
**Revisit when:** Build path step 4 (storage and sync).

**Question:** When two devices or two people edit the same data, what wins: last write per row, a change log with merge rules per table, or CRDTs on SQLite (e.g. cr-sqlite)?

**Notes:** Safe to defer: Rapidkoi owns each app's database (DECISION-004), so any of the three stays possible. See `docs/source/meetings/2026-10-17-architecture.md`.

---

### DECISION-014 — Running two apps at once (kivuli single-instance)

**Status:** deferred
**Raised:** 2026-10-17 — Session 5
**Revisit when:** The shell runs more than one app, or a second launch must open a second app.

**Question:** kivuli starts GTK with `gtk_application_new(id, 0)` (`../kivuli/src/live.la:74`), so GTK makes the program single-instance: a second `./main other.wasm` raises the first window and drops the new app. Should kivuli accept application flags (e.g. `G_APPLICATION_NON_UNIQUE`, or `HANDLES_OPEN` for links later)?

**Notes:** A kivuli gap, fixed upstream when needed. Step 1 runs one app, so it's a known limitation. Build path step 2 (links) will need `HANDLES_OPEN`-style behaviour anyway.

---

### DECISION-015 — A file-size query in std.fs (lughac)

**Status:** deferred
**Raised:** 2026-10-17 — Session 5
**Revisit when:** Opening apps that aren't local files the person chose (step 2), or the next lughac std work.

**Question:** `std.fs` has no size query, so the shell's 32 MB module cap is checked after `read_bytes` has read the whole file. Add `fs.size(path)` (or `metadata`) to lughac's std?

**Notes:** A lughac gap, reported upstream. Acceptable for step 1: the file is local and chosen by the person.

---

### DECISION-016 — A read-only text input (kivuli)

**Status:** open
**Raised:** 2026-10-17 — Session 6
**Resolved by:** human
**Blocks:** Contract v1 inputs without `on_change` (shown as disabled).

**Question:** kivuli's `.disabled()` only affects buttons (`../kivuli/src/views.la`, `disabled`); a text field can't be made read-only or insensitive. How should the shell show an `input` with no `on_change`?

**Options:**
- A) Add `.disabled(true)` support for text fields to kivuli (`gtk_widget_set_sensitive(false)`, like buttons), in a kivuli session, then render it here. *Recommended: it matches "no handler means disabled" everywhere.*
- B) Change contract v1 so `on_change` is required on inputs. A contract change: needs a version decision.

**Notes:** Until then `contract.read_tree` refuses such an input with a visible contract error ("an input without \"on_change\" isn't supported yet"), never a fake read-only field.

---

### DECISION-017 — Listing a module's exports (lugha-wasmtime)

**Status:** deferred
**Raised:** 2026-10-17 — Session 6
**Revisit when:** The next lugha-wasmtime PRP, or before build path step 2.

**Question:** lugha-wasmtime can't list a module's or instance's exports and their types, so the shell can't check `alloc`, `init`, `update` and `view` before calling them (PRP-001 asked for that). Add export listing (`wasmtime_module_exports` / `wasmtime_instance_export_nth`) upstream?

**Notes:** Safe meanwhile: a missing or mistyped export fails its first call with `MissingExport`/`WrongExport` and the error screen. `memory` and `rapidkoi_version` are still checked at load. Just later than ideal: a missing `update` shows on the first click.

## RESOLVED

### DECISION-012 — UI contract v1

**Status:** resolved
**Raised:** 2026-10-17 — Session 4
**Resolved:** 2026-10-17 — Session 4

**Question:** What exactly passes between a guest and the shell?

**Outcome:** CBOR. Nodes are `{kind, props, children?, key?}`; step 1 kinds are text, button, input, column, row. Props are semantic only (no pixels or colours). Unknown props are ignored; unknown kinds render a placeholder. Messages are opaque app-chosen CBOR values, returned in an envelope `{msg, value?}`. No handler means disabled. The guest exports `rapidkoi_version() → 1`, `init`, `update(state, event) → {state, effects: []}` and `view(state)`; the shell holds the state bytes. Limits: fuel ≈100 ms per call, 256 MB memory, view 4 MB / 10,000 nodes / depth 64, strings 64 KB, state 16 MB. A failing app stops alone, behind a Restart screen. Full detail: `docs/source/meetings/2026-10-17-ui-contract.md`.

**Rationale:** Language-neutral, inspectable, one crossing per call; semantic props let the person's settings apply to every app; reserved `key` and `effects` avoid breaking changes later.

**Copied to MEMORY.md:** yes

### DECISION-013 — lugha-cbor

**Status:** resolved
**Raised:** 2026-10-17 — Session 4
**Resolved:** 2026-10-17 — Session 4

**Question:** Where does the CBOR code live?

**Outcome:** A standalone, pure-Lugha package `../lugha-cbor` (package `cbor`), built before the shell. Its decoder is safe on hostile input.

**Rationale:** MEMORY.md decision 9: generic pieces are their own packages.

**Copied to MEMORY.md:** yes

### DECISION-003 — Which WebAssembly runtime the shell embeds

**Status:** resolved
**Raised:** 2026-10-17 — Session 2
**Resolved:** 2026-10-17 — Session 3

**Question:** Which C-API WebAssembly runtime does the shell embed?

**Outcome:** wasmtime, through its C API, wrapped by the separate Lugha package `lugha-wasmtime` (DECISION-010).

**Rationale:** The most mature and hardened option, with fuel/epoch and memory limits for untrusted code. WAMR is the fallback to reconsider for Android (DECISION-007).

**Copied to MEMORY.md:** yes

### DECISION-004 — Where an app's state lives

**Status:** resolved
**Raised:** 2026-10-17 — Session 2
**Resolved:** 2026-10-17 — Session 3

**Question:** Does the guest own its state, or does the platform hold it?

**Outcome:** Two kinds of state. Screen state (route, filters, drafts, selection) is a serialisable model Rapidkoi holds; apps are Elm-shaped (`init`, `update`, `view`). App data lives in a per-app SQLite database that Rapidkoi owns and provides (from build path step 3 or 4); queries and writes are effects, with live-query subscriptions. Apps don't bundle their own database. Conflict handling is DECISION-011.

**Rationale:** Platform-held screen state gives links, history and live sessions to every app. A real database is needed for offline apps (the owner's point), and Rapidkoi owning it keeps sync, export, inspection and removal possible. SQLite fits many small reads and writes; DuckDB is for analytics.

**Copied to MEMORY.md:** yes

### DECISION-005 — The guest↔host UI contract

**Status:** resolved
**Raised:** 2026-10-17 — Session 2
**Resolved:** 2026-10-17 — Session 3

**Question:** How does a bundle hand its view tree to the shell, and how do events get back?

**Outcome:** The guest writes its whole view tree into its memory as one compact, versioned encoding per update; the shell decodes it into kivuli `View`s, and kivuli diffs. Events go back to the guest as its own encoded messages. Step 1 components: text, button, text input, column, row. The exact encoding is designed in the step 1 PRP and stays language-neutral.

**Rationale:** One crossing per update, simple, inspectable, and independent of any guest language.

**Copied to MEMORY.md:** yes

---

### DECISION-006 — The first guest language and test bundles

**Status:** resolved
**Raised:** 2026-10-17 — Session 2
**Resolved:** 2026-10-17 — Session 3

**Question:** What language is the first guest UI library and demo bundle written in?

**Outcome:** Rust (`wasm32-unknown-unknown`), in this repo under `guest/rust/`. The shell's own tests use hand-written `.wat` fixtures, so `lughac test` never needs Rust. A lughac WebAssembly target and a Lugha guest library are a later milestone in the lugha repository.

**Rationale:** Rust is the best-supported WebAssembly language and already installed; lughac emits native code only today.

**Copied to MEMORY.md:** yes

### DECISION-010 — Rapidkoi grows Lugha's ecosystem

**Status:** resolved
**Raised:** 2026-10-17 — Session 3
**Resolved:** 2026-10-17 — Session 3

**Question:** Where do general-purpose pieces built for Rapidkoi live?

**Outcome:** A second project goal is improving Lugha's ecosystem. Generic pieces (runtime bindings, database bindings) are standalone Lugha packages in their own repositories, starting with `lugha-wasmtime` (package `wasmtime`) from day one. Rapidkoi-specific pieces (link parser, UI encoding) start in this repo and split out once their shape settles. kivuli and lughac gaps are fixed upstream.

**Rationale:** The owner's direction (`docs/source/meetings/2026-10-17-architecture.md`).

**Copied to MEMORY.md:** yes

### DECISION-001 — What rapidkoi is for

**Status:** resolved
**Raised:** 2026-10-17 — Session 1
**Resolved:** 2026-10-17 — Session 2

**Question:** What does rapidkoi do, and for whom?

**Outcome:** A native app for running apps: each app lives at an address, every screen has a link carrying route and state, and apps are sandboxed, signed WebAssembly bundles that describe their UI as a component tree Rapidkoi renders. Build path: shell → links → a real app → storage and sync → live sessions → history.

**Rationale:** The project owner's vision, recorded in `docs/source/stakeholder/vision-2026-10-17.md`.

**Copied to MEMORY.md:** yes
