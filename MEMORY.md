# MEMORY.md — rapidkoi

Records resolved architectural decisions and current project state.
Read this at the start of every session before writing any code.

## ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

### 1. Lugha + kivuli

**Decision:** rapidkoi is written in Lugha and its UI is built with kivuli 0.1, pulled in as a git package in `lugha.toml`.

**Why:** The project was started this way (`lughac init` with kivuli listed as a package). kivuli gives a pure, testable Elm-architecture app over GTK 4.

**Rules out:** Calling GTK directly from rapidkoi, other UI toolkits, and mutable UI state outside `update`.

---

### 2. Return-based error handling

**Decision:** Expected failures return `Result<T, E>` with a per-module error enum; programmer errors `panic`.

**Why:** Failure paths show in the type and can't be ignored. Matches kivuli and lugha-gtk.

**Rules out:** `Option` as an error, string errors, `unwrap` on external input.

---

### 3. Context system

**Decision:** The project follows `docs/setup.md`: CLAUDE.md, MEMORY.md, CONTEXT.md, DECISIONS.md, CHANGELOG.md, .llmignore, PRPs/, docs/.

**Why:** Keeps AI sessions consistent across handoffs. Same setup as `../kivuli`.

**Rules out:** Feature code without a PRP; architectural choices made silently.

---

### 4. What rapidkoi is (DECISION-001)

**Decision:** This repository is the Rapidkoi shell: a native desktop app that runs sandboxed WebAssembly apps ("bundles"), each at an address, each screen linkable with its state. Guests describe their UI as a component tree; the shell renders it through kivuli and gives every app the platform features (links, permissions, storage, sync, live sessions, history). Work follows the vision's build path in order: 1 the shell, 2 links, 3 a real app, 4 storage and sync, 5 live sessions, 6 history.

**Why:** The owner's vision: `docs/source/stakeholder/vision-2026-10-17.md`.

**Rules out:** Guests drawing their own widgets or touching GTK; guests reaching any resource except through the shell; work from a later build-path step before the earlier ones are done.

## CURRENT PROJECT STATE

### Fully Working
- `src/main.la` prints a greeting; it passes `lughac check` and `fmt --check`.
- Context system in place (session 1). Vision recorded (session 2).

### In Progress
- Nothing.

### Not Started
- Build path step 1, the shell: blocked on DECISION-003 (runtime), 004 (where state lives), 005 (UI contract), 006 (first guest language).

## NEXT SESSION START POINT

Read CLAUDE.md, MEMORY.md, DECISIONS.md and CONTEXT.md. Resolve DECISIONS 003–006 with the user, then run a discovery interview for step 1 (the shell) and write `PRPs/prp-001-shell.md`.
