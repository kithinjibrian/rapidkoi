# MEMORY.md — rapidkoi

Records resolved architectural decisions and current project state.
Read this at the start of every session before writing any code.

## ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

### 1. Lugha + kivuli

**Decision:** rapidkoi is written in Lugha and its UI is built with kivuli 0.1, pulled in as a git package in `lugha.toml`.

**Why:** The project was started this way (`lughac init` with kivuli listed as a package). kivuli gives a pure, testable Elm-architecture app over GTK 4.

**Rules out:** Calling GTK directly from rapidkoi, other UI toolkits, and mutable UI state outside `update`.

---

### 2. Return-based error handling

**Decision:** Expected failures return `Result<T, E>` with a per-module error enum; programmer errors `panic`.

**Why:** Failure paths show in the type and can't be ignored. Matches kivuli and lugha-gtk.

**Rules out:** `Option` as an error, string errors, `unwrap` on external input.

---

### 3. Context system

**Decision:** The project follows `docs/setup.md`: CLAUDE.md, MEMORY.md, CONTEXT.md, DECISIONS.md, CHANGELOG.md, .llmignore, PRPs/, docs/.

**Why:** Keeps AI sessions consistent across handoffs. Same setup as `../kivuli`.

**Rules out:** Feature code without a PRP; architectural choices made silently.

---

### 4. What rapidkoi is (DECISION-001)

**Decision:** This repository is the Rapidkoi shell: a native desktop app that runs sandboxed WebAssembly apps ("bundles"), each at an address, each screen linkable with its state. Guests describe their UI as a component tree; the shell renders it through kivuli and gives every app the platform features (links, permissions, storage, sync, live sessions, history). Work follows the vision's build path in order: 1 the shell, 2 links, 3 a real app, 4 storage and sync, 5 live sessions, 6 history.

**Why:** The owner's vision: `docs/source/stakeholder/vision-2026-10-17.md`.

**Rules out:** Guests drawing their own widgets or touching GTK; guests reaching any resource except through the shell; work from a later build-path step before the earlier ones are done.

---

### 5. Screen state in the model, app data in SQLite (DECISION-004)

**Decision:** Apps are Elm-shaped (`init`, `update`, `view`) and Rapidkoi holds their screen-state model. App data lives in a per-app SQLite database Rapidkoi owns, reached through effects and live-query subscriptions (build path step 3 or 4).

**Why:** Links, history and live sessions need the platform to see screen state; offline apps need a real database; owning it keeps sync, export and removal possible.

**Rules out:** Guests keeping hidden screen state, guests bundling their own database, the whole dataset in the model, DuckDB as the default.

---

### 6. One versioned UI description per update (DECISION-005)

**Decision:** The guest returns its whole view tree as one compact, versioned, language-neutral encoding; the shell turns it into kivuli `View`s. Events go back as the guest's own encoded messages.

**Why:** One crossing per update, inspectable, independent of guest language.

**Rules out:** Host builder imports, the Component Model for now, an unversioned format.

---

### 7. wasmtime through lugha-wasmtime (DECISION-003, DECISION-010)

**Decision:** The shell runs guests with wasmtime's C API, through the separate package `../lugha-wasmtime` (package name `wasmtime`).

**Why:** Hardened, with fuel and memory limits; separate bindings serve all of Lugha.

**Rules out:** wasm2c, wasm3, writing wasmtime externs inside rapidkoi.

---

### 8. Rust for the first guest (DECISION-006)

**Decision:** The guest UI library and demo app are Rust, under `guest/rust/`; the shell's tests use `.wat` fixtures.

**Why:** lughac can't target WebAssembly yet; Rust is the best-supported guest language.

**Rules out:** Rust in the shell's test suite; anything in the UI encoding that only suits Rust.

---

### 9. Grow Lugha's ecosystem (DECISION-010)

**Decision:** Generic pieces become standalone Lugha packages in their own repos; Rapidkoi-specific ones split out once stable; kivuli and lughac gaps are fixed upstream.

**Why:** A goal of the project, beside Rapidkoi itself.

**Rules out:** Generic bindings buried in rapidkoi; silent workarounds for Lugha gaps.

---

### 10. UI contract v1 (DECISION-012)

**Decision:** Guests and the shell speak CBOR. Nodes are `{kind, props, children?, key?}` with semantic props only. Messages are opaque, returned as `{msg, value?}`. Guests export `rapidkoi_version`, `init`, `update → {state, effects}` and `view`; the shell holds state. Fixed limits; a failing app stops alone. Detail: `docs/source/meetings/2026-10-17-ui-contract.md`.

**Why:** Language-neutral, inspectable, and every person's settings apply to every app.

**Rules out:** Pixel or colour props; the shell interpreting app messages; guest-held state; failing a whole screen over an unknown kind; changing v1 without bumping the version.

---

### 11. lugha-cbor (DECISION-013)

**Decision:** CBOR lives in the standalone pure-Lugha package `../lugha-cbor` (`cbor`), built before the shell.

**Why:** Generic and useful to all of Lugha (decision 9).

**Rules out:** A CBOR decoder inside rapidkoi.

---

### 12. Rapidkoi's own UI (meeting 2026-10-17, ui-design)

**Decision:**
- **The frame:** the system title bar; Rapidkoi's bar (← ⌂ →, address/search, ⓘ, ⤴); a tab rail on the right (tabs, +, divider, settings).
- **Home:** logo, "Where you left off", a Pinned grid. Visual: big tiles and banners.
- **History:** on-device and searchable.
- **Pictures:** page banner → app banner → generated art. No screenshots.
- **App info:** a panel.
- **Contract:** optional root props `title`, `banner`, `private`.

Built in PRP-002 (frame and tabs) and PRP-003 (remembering), before links. Missing kivuli features get explicit placeholders (DECISION-018).

**Why:** The owner's sketches and direction (`docs/source/meetings/2026-10-17-ui-design.md`). With no search engine, Rapidkoi's memory is how people find things again.

**Rules out:** Screenshots of what people saw; apps drawing in the bar or rail; history leaving the device; silent workarounds for kivuli gaps.

---

### 13. Packaging (meeting 2026-10-18)

**Decision:**
- One module per app (room for prerendered screens later).
- **One app per host.** A build is identified by its manifest's hash; a version is the publisher's semver name for one build.
- The device keeps the previous build. Versions can be withdrawn.
- **Everything Rapidkoi holds for an app carries the version that wrote it:** `state_version`, an optional `migrate`, and starting over without one.
- Now: a single-file CBOR bundle `.rkb` (format 1), packed with `./main pack`. Signing comes later.

**Why:** The owner, after framing the problem first (`docs/source/meetings/2026-10-18-packaging.md`).

**Rules out:** Server-run apps by default; per-screen code chunks for now; several apps on one host; state without a version.

---

## CURRENT PROJECT STATE

### Fully Working
- `src/main.la` prints a greeting; it passes `lughac check` and `fmt --check`.
- Context system in place (session 1). Vision recorded (session 2). Architecture decisions recorded (session 3). UI contract v1 designed (session 4).
- `../lugha-wasmtime` PRP-001 (core runtime) merged in that repo: everything the shell needs.
- **Build path step 1, the shell (PRP-001), merged in session 7:** `./main app.wasm` runs a guest under contract v1; a Rust crate and counter demo in `guest/rust/`. 47 Lugha tests, 7 Rust tests.
- **Rapidkoi's frame and tabs (PRP-002 + Amendment 1), merged in session 10:** the bar, an app-only tab rail, home (Where you left off, Pinned, search), the info panel, the dark theme defined (placeholder). 73 Lugha tests.
- **Bundles (PRP-003), merged in session 20:** `./main pack` makes a `.rkb` (format 1); `./main app.rkb` or typing its path opens it. 95 Lugha tests.
- **Local development (PRP-004), merged in session 23:** `./main serve app.rkb` (127.0.0.1 only); `rapidkoi://localhost:PORT` opens it; Reload. 115 Lugha tests.

### In Progress
- Nothing.

### Not Started
- Build path step 2 (links). Next: DECISION-016, then the links discovery interview.

## NEXT SESSION START POINT

After `../lugha-cbor`'s PRP-001 is merged: open a session, read the four files and `docs/source/meetings/2026-10-17-ui-contract.md`, then write `PRPs/prp-001-shell.md` implementing contract v1 exactly, and build it after approval.
